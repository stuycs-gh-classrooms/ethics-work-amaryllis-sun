Columbia Business School - “Business disruption happens when an existing industry faces a challenger that offers far greater value to the customer in a way that existing firms cannot compete with directly”

Was heavily inspired by Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma
Some people claim that because he was a Harvard Business School professor, people blindly follow what he says 

Examples of “Disruptive” Companies:
Uber
Airbnb
Amazon
Tesla
Spotify

Pros:
Can force innovation to occur 
E.g. “Spotify Wrapped” influenced the same practice in other digital companies like Apple Music, Depop, and Netflix
Makes it more profitable for these companies since consumers like seeing it
Lowers prices and makes the product more accessible to the general public (at least temporarily)
Influences how the competing companies operate, advancing the field as a whole
Prioritizes the customer over profits
Customers are more satisfied and interested in the product

Counterclaims:
So much disruption can “blow up” an industry and lead to more harm rather than benefit
Response: “Successful disruptors might break old models, but they build better ones that benefit us all, which is why we embrace, rather than fear them.”


The term “disruption” as a business model was first coined by Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma. In it, he explains disruption as a product that creates a new market, disrupts an existing market, and replaces an existing product. As noted, some examples of these products are Uber, which forced the taxi industry to improve their quality standards while making it more convenient for customers to use, and Tesla, which released its patent holdings to promote open-source innovation.

Looking at disruption from a business perspective, these companies are wildly successful today, with Uber stock prices having risen 132.27% and Tesla stock prices having risen 1,419.49% in the past 5 years. It seems to make sense: when customers are introduced to a new, appealing (and sometimes cheaper) product that defies their traditional expectations, they’ll be interested. It may redefine
