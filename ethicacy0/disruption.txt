Pro-Disruption

Columbia Business School - “Business disruption happens when an existing industry faces a challenger that offers far greater value to the customer in a way that existing firms cannot compete with directly”

Examples of “Disruptive” Companies:
Uber
Airbnb
Amazon
Tesla
Spotify

Pros:
Can force innovation to occur 
Lowers prices and makes the product more accessible to the general public (at least temporarily)
Influences how the competing companies operate, advancing the field as a whole
Prioritizes the customer over profits
Customers are more satisfied and interested in the product
